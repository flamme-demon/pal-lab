# pal-extract

Dev-time tool that reads a local Palworld install (`Pal-Windows.pak`, UE 5.1) via
[CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse) and emits the game data our app lacks:
per-species elements, stats, partner-skill names/descriptions/icons, full passive-skill data,
active-skill (waza) stats (element/power/cooldown/description), and the
real `Combi_*` breeding weight arrays, plus element icons. It is NOT part of the cargo/bun workspace
and is never shipped.

Output: `out/extracted-game-data.json` (species + passives) + `out/icons/elements/<Kind>_{tile,glyph}.png`
and `out/icons/partner/<textureId>.png`. Partner-skill descriptions come from `DT_PalFirstActivatedInfoText`;
passives from `DT_PassiveSkill_Main` (names/descs via `DT_Skill{Name,Desc}Text_Common` `PASSIVE_*` keys);
partner icons keyed by `DT_partnerSkillIconDataTable` `TextureID` (glyphs resolved from
`T_icon_skill_pal_<NNN>` where a numbered texture exists; TextureIDs 0-20). Run `--discover` to
full-text search the `L10N/en` text tables for a UI string and report its table + row key.

Active skills (`active_skills`, keyed by the save-side waza id) come from
`Pal/Content/Pal/DataTable/Waza/DT_WazaDataTable`. Each row is keyed generically (`NewRow_N`); the
save-side id is the row's `WazaType` enum (`EPalWazaID::<id>`, prefix stripped). Per skill we emit
`{ name, element, power, cool_time, description }`: `element` is the `EPalElementType` enum name
(same strings as species elements — `Normal/Fire/Water/Leaf/Electricity/Ice/Earth/Dark/Dragon`, plus
`None` for the two name-only fallbacks below); `power` is the `Power` field (null when 0/non-damage);
`cool_time` is `CoolTime` rounded to whole seconds (null when 0); `description` and `name` come from
`DT_Skill{Desc,Name}Text_Common` under the `ACTION_SKILL_<id>` key, `Clean()`ed with embedded rich
tags (`<characterName>`/`<itemName>`/…) resolved to English text. Rows without a resolvable name are
skipped. To preserve the old `active_names` coverage set, every `ACTION_SKILL_<id>` name lacking a
waza row is folded in as a name-only entry (`element:"None"`, null stats), matched case-insensitively
against waza keys so a casing drift (`WazaType Railbolt` vs text `RailBolt`) never emits a duplicate.
This replaces the former flat `active_names` map.

Partner-skill descriptions embed `{templates}` the game fills per partner-skill *level* (rank
1..N). They are resolved from `DT_PartnerSkillParameter` (under `.../PassiveSkill/`, keyed by
species internal name) + `DT_PassiveSkill_Main` + `DT_PartnerSkillAppendText`:
`{PassiveN_EffectValueM}` / `{ReferencePassiveN_EffectValueM}` -> the rank-r passive N's
`EffectValueM`; `{ActiveSkillMainValueByRank}` / `{ActiveSkillOverWriteEffectTime}` -> the
rank-scaled active-skill arrays; `{ReferenceMsgId_X}` -> append-text row `X_Rank_1` (the game's
Lv.1 message, blank today; resolved recursively + cycle-guarded). Each numeric value is computed
at every rank and emitted as a single number if constant across ranks, else `(min~max)` — matching
the game (e.g. Cattiva carry capacity `(100~200)`). Element-swap variants carry stub param rows and
inherit the base pal's data. Any template that cannot be resolved from static data is left verbatim
and reported (`[partner-template UNRESOLVED]`); the run gates on zero unresolved `{` placeholders.

Run `--export-named-partner-icons` for the bespoke follow-up: it exports every
`T_icon_skill_pal_<Name>` texture (the non-numbered glyphs) to `out/icons/partner-named/<Name>.png`
with a JSON manifest, and where a texture name exactly matches a `DT_partnerSkillIconDataTable` row
key it copies the PNG to `app/public/partner/<TextureID>.png` so that numeric key resolves. Most
bespoke row keys (species names, TextureID 21+) have no individual texture in this build — only shared
category glyphs plus a few species-specific ones (KingWhale, SwordCutlassfish, ThunderDragonMan) exist,
so this resolves only those. No fuzzy number->glyph guessing (no authoritative ordering exists).

`Mappings.usmap` (gitignored) is the type-mapping file for the installed build; source:
https://github.com/PalworldModding/UsefulFiles (kept in sync with the installed game version).

## Run

Requires the .NET 10 SDK (CUE4Parse 1.2.2.202607 targets net10.0). Oodle is auto-downloaded.

```
dotnet run -c Release
```

Paths default to the standard Steam install and `./Mappings.usmap`; override with env vars
`PALCALC_PALWORLD_PAKS` (folder containing `Pal-Windows.pak`) and `PALCALC_MAPPINGS_USMAP`.
Set `PALCALC_GAME_BUILD` to the installed Steam build id when refreshing map data.
The run asserts validation gates (species >= 299, Lamball partner skill + "becomes a shield"
description, Jormuntide elements, non-empty Combi arrays, `Legend`/`Lucky` passives with effects,
a negative-rank passive, partner coverage, zero unresolved `{` template placeholders across all
partner descriptions, Cattiva's resolved carry-capacity range `100~200`, and active skills:
`active_skills` count >= 300 with zero coverage regressions vs the old name set, `AirCanon`
resolving to name "Air Cannon"/element `Normal`/power > 0, and `Unique_SheepBall_Roll` resolvable)
and exits non-zero if any fail.

## Map extraction (`--export-map`)

`dotnet run -c Release -- --export-map` emits the World-Map assets the app's Map view needs, into
`app/public/map/`:

- `worldmap.webp` / `treemap.webp` — `T_WorldMap` / `T_TreeMap` (both 8192x8192) re-encoded as lossy
  WebP (SkiaSharp, quality 85; each gated `<=10MB`).
- `map-data.json` — per-layer metadata plus spawns/bosses/effigies/fast-travel/bounties:
  - `maps.{MainMap,Tree}`: `image`, `px`, `world_min`, `world_max`, `mask_px`, and the calibrated
    `world_to_px` formula string (see below) — bounds sourced from `DT_WorldMapUIData` (never hardcoded).
  - `spawns`: one entry per (species, map). Built by joining `DT_PalSpawnerPlacement` to
    `DT_PalWildSpawner` on the wild row's **`SpawnerName` field** (placement `SpawnerName`, then each
    stripped `LayerNames` entry, exact-matches that group key — ~99.6% coverage; the residual join-miss
    count is reported). Each `Pal_1..3` slot becomes a point at the placement `Location`/`StaticRadius`
    with level/count ranges, `time` (`day`/`night`/null), `weather` (raw or null), and a `boss` flag
    (`SpawnerType==FieldBoss`). NPC-only slots and non-species `Pal` values (e.g. `RowName`) are dropped.
  - `bosses`: `DT_BossSpawnerLoactionData` rows with a real pal `CharacterID` (rows for human/NPC
    bosses carry no `CharacterID` and are excluded).
  - `effigies` / `fast_travel`: a World-Partition actor sweep of `Pal/Content/Pal/Maps/MainWorld_5`
    (~10k cells, ~60s) for `BP_LevelObject_Relic_C`, its `BP_LevelObject_Relic_<CharacterID>_C`
    variants, and `BP_LevelObject_TowerFastTravelPoint_C`, each
    resolved via its **own** `RootComponent(FPackageIndex) -> RelativeLocation` (a naive first-component
    grab yields bogus constants). Fast-travel names resolve from `DT_MapRespawnPointInfoText` keyed by
    the actor's `FastTravelPointID`, else null. Each effigy carries `item_id`, matching the
    `effigy_types` metadata (`id`, English game-item `name`, icon-manifest `icon`). The legacy
    unsuffixed blueprint uses item `Relic`; variants exact-match their localized Pal name
    against `DT_ItemNameText_Common`, with icons resolved from `DT_ItemIconDataTable`.
  - `bounties`: fixed PIDF wanted-target humanoid boss NPCs (the purple-hood map "bounty" POIs), from
    the same `MainWorld_5` actor sweep for `BP_(Mono|Squad)NPCSpawnerBossBase_<CID>_C` placed actors,
    resolved via `RootComponent -> RelativeLocation`. Their `cid` comes from the blueprint
    default `SaveKeyName`, checked against `DT_PalBossNPCIcon`. This includes four trader-type
    wanted bosses; ordinary merchants are excluded. Class-name tokens are not a reliable
    discriminator. Each entry is `{x, y, map, name, cid}`: `name` is
    always `null` (bounty NPC names are procedural, assigned from a pool at spawn — no fixed name per
    location), `cid` is the humanoid boss `CharacterID` (enemy-type metadata for the pin hover). Spawn
    locations are 100% static (gameplay ground truth); gated on count and world-spread (not clustered).

  - `towers`: named tower-entrance fast-travel points retain their existing region-key join.
    World Tree arenas are additionally extracted from `BP_PalBossTower_LastBoss_C` and
    `BP_PalBossTower_MiddleBoss_C` actor positions. Their `BossType` resolves the
    `BOSS_BATTLE_NAME_*` UI text; the final arena uses the nearby named fast-travel landmark
    because its boss-name text is deliberately hidden. These four have `key:null`: a nearby
    fast-travel point does not establish a reached/defeated save-state join.

Every point is assigned to `MainMap` or `Tree` by world-bounds containment (Tree checked first);
points in neither are dropped with a logged count.

**Axis calibration.** The world->pixel orientation is calibrated empirically: all 8 candidate
orientations (axis swap x two flips) are scored by the fraction of boss/fast-travel/effigy points that
land on non-ocean pixels of the decoded worldmap; the winner is written verbatim into `world_to_px`
and a diagnostic overlay is saved to `testdata/probe/calibration.png` (evidence). The winner for the
current build is `u_px = (worldY-world_min[1])/(world_max[1]-world_min[1]) * px[0]; v_px =
(world_max[0]-worldX)/(world_max[0]-world_min[0]) * px[1]` (u = pixel x, v = pixel y, top-left origin),
i.e. horizontal tracks worldY and vertical tracks worldX flipped — consistent with the community
`MapX=(worldY-158000)/459, MapY=(worldX+123888)/459` axis mapping. The run gates on webp size/dims,
plausible spawn/boss/effigy/fast-travel counts, calibration dominance over the runner-up, and
ground-truth spot checks (`BOSS_Horus_Water` at X=-867560.875 Y=-441338.219 Lv66 on MainMap, the
`WorldTree_MiddleBoss_1` -> "Rotmist Root" fast-travel name, and non-empty `SheepBall` spawns).

## Map icons (`--export-map-icons`)

`dotnet run -c Release -- --export-map-icons` emits `app/public/map/icons/<key>.png` (native-res,
transparent) plus an `icons.json` manifest. Each entry is `{file, px:[w,h], source, mono}`. The
key->asset mapping is curated by visual inspection of the `--discover-map-icons` probe thumbnails;
`marker_0..16` map the custom-marker palette to the ordinal `T_icon_compass_00..16` textures.

`mono` (boolean) flags source art that is a white/gray silhouette needing runtime tinting: it is set
when opaque pixels are `>=95%` near-white/neutral (saturation `<0.08` AND value `>0.75`). The consumer
re-tints `mono:true` icons via a CSS `mask-image` pipeline (alpha channel only); `mono:false` icons
render as-is. It is measured per icon, never forced — on the current build only `alpha_badge` (the
white boss/alpha ring frame) qualifies; the colored diamond-framed compass glyphs, the green effigy,
and the purple bounty portrait are all `mono:false`.

## Data-grounding discovery modes

Read-only sweeps that establish (never guess) the mappings baked into the exporters, each writing an
evidence log under `testdata/probe/`: `--discover-incident` (incident/bounty DataTables ->
`bounty.log`), `--discover-bounty-actors` (world-partition NPC/spawner actor histogram + bounty/FT
actor locations -> `bounty-actors.log`), `--discover-effigies` (relic variant assets, actor counts
and blueprint samples -> `effigies.log`), `--list-dt` (all DataTable paths -> `datatables.log`), and
`--dump-table <pkgPath>` (one DataTable's rows to stdout).


## Map coverage audit (Steam build 25246127)

The refreshed manifest was extracted from a local `Pal-Windows.pak`. No external
map dataset is used by the exporter or the shipped manifest.

| Category | Main map | World Tree | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Placed effigies | 360 | 47 | 407 |
| Fast-travel points | 137 | 15 | 152 |
| Tower landmarks | 9 | 4 | 13 |
| Wanted targets | 33 | 0 | 33 |

The twelve placed effigy types are Lifmunk (155); Lamball, Pengullet, Munchill,
Rooby, Herbil, Tanzee, Depresso and Cattiva (30 each); Lunaris, Relaxaurus and
Yakumo (4 each). The Mimog item exists in the game's item table but has no
placed relic actor and is therefore not emitted as a map pin. All 407 placed
effigies have distinct non-null UE-Digits GUIDs. Existing world bounds, image
orientation and player-GUID joins are preserved. Field bosses (90 entries) and
species spawn data (542 species/map groups) are also re-extracted.

This audit covers the map's existing POI categories. Dungeon entrances, ruins,
watchtowers, ordinary merchants and resource nodes do not currently have
rendered layers; they remain separate feature work. Tower reachability only
tracks six region keys; keyless landmarks display neutrally without inventing
completion flags. The filter's tower count includes all landmarks, with tracked
reachability shown in its tooltip.
