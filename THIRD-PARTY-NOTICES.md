# Third-Party Notices

Pal Lab bundles or derives from third-party material. This file lists that
material, its origin, and its license. It supplements — and does not replace —
the per-directory `NOTICE`/`README.md` files vendored alongside the code and
data (referenced below); consult those for the fuller, file-level detail.

The distributed Pal Lab desktop binary combines these components. Every one of
them — including the `oozextract` Oodle decompressor (below) — is permissively
licensed, so Pal Lab is distributed under the **MIT License** (see the root
`LICENSE`). The `pal-data` and `pal-solver` crates additionally carry their own
MIT `LICENSE` for reuse outside the combined binary.

## 1. tylercamp/palcalc — MIT

- Upstream: https://github.com/tylercamp/palcalc
- License: MIT
- What we use:
  - **Vendored data files** `db.json` and `breeding.json`
    (`crates/pal-data/vendor/`), included unmodified from `PalCalc.Model/` as a
    day-one data contract (species, passives, active skills, elements, gender
    probabilities; full breeding table + minimum-breeding-steps matrix). These
    are converted to a compact binary pack at build time.
  - **Numeric probability test oracles** used to gate solver correctness
    (palcalc's MIT breeding-probability fixtures).
  - **Icon assets** (pal icons, element/passive-rank icons, work-suitability
    icons) sourced from `PalCalc.UI/Resources/`, renamed but with image bytes
    unchanged.

For the authoritative per-file breakdown of exactly which palcalc files are
vendored, how they were renamed, and the game-data provenance, see
[`crates/pal-data/vendor/NOTICE`](crates/pal-data/vendor/NOTICE). That NOTICE is
the source of truth; this section summarizes it.

Note: palcalc's bundled icons and the vendored data are ultimately game data /
assets from Palworld © Pocketpair, Inc., included for personal, non-commercial
use. All rights to the underlying data and artwork remain with Pocketpair.

## 2. lvlvllvlvllvlvl/oozextract — MIT

- Upstream: https://github.com/lvlvllvlvllvlvl/oozextract
- License: MIT
- What we use: the crate's Oodle **Kraken** decompressor — a pure-Rust port of
  powzix/ooz — consumed as an ordinary Cargo dependency of `pal-save`.
  `pal-save` uses **decompression only** to read Palworld `Level.sav` payloads
  (saves are read-only for us). Nothing is vendored and there is no C/C++
  toolchain dependency.

Because oozextract is MIT-licensed, linking it into `pal-save` and thence into
the desktop app imposes no copyleft obligation: the combined Pal Lab binary
ships under the MIT License.

## 3. cheahjs/palworld-save-tools — MIT (format-documentation reference only)

- Upstream: https://github.com/cheahjs/palworld-save-tools
- License: MIT
- What we use: **nothing is vendored or ported.** This project is used purely as
  a *format specification reference* for GVAS property encoding and Palworld
  `Level.sav` `RawData` layouts. `pal-save`'s parser was written independently in
  Rust; several source comments cite the corresponding Python modules as the
  spec they follow, e.g.:
  - `archive.rs` — "Mirrors the primitive readers in cheahjs/palworld-save-tools
    `archive.py`"
  - `gvas.rs` — "Property encoding follows cheahjs/palworld-save-tools
    `gvas.py`/`archive.py`"
  - `characters.rs` — "Field layout follows cheahjs/palworld-save-tools
    `rawdata/character.py`" (and `rawdata/worker_director.py`, `rawdata/group.py`)
  - `map_objects.rs` — cites the `rawdata/map_object` lineage for the fixed
    header layout

  These are documentation citations describing where the binary format is
  documented, not copied code. No Python was translated line-for-line and no
  files were vendored. (Verified by grepping `crates/pal-save` for
  save-tools/cheahjs references: all matches are `//!`/`//`/`///` comments.)

## 4. oMaN-Rod/palworld-save-pal — MIT

- Upstream: https://github.com/oMaN-Rod/palworld-save-pal
- License: MIT
- What we use:
  - the alpha (field-boss) marker icon at `app/public/ui/alpha.png`,
    transcoded from that project's `ui/src/lib/assets/img/alpha.webp` (WEBP → PNG,
    pixels unchanged). Detailed in
    [`crates/pal-data/vendor/NOTICE`](crates/pal-data/vendor/NOTICE) (Alpha / UI
    marker icon section). The icon is ultimately a Palworld game asset ©
    Pocketpair, Inc.
  - **format documentation** for the Xbox / Game Pass (WGS) save container
    store: `crates/pal-save/src/wgs.rs` implements the `containers.index` /
    `container.<N>` layouts and the Palworld container-name → save-file mapping
    as documented by that project's `psp-core/src/gamepass/` sources (and by
    palworld-save-tools for the CNK compression wrapper). No code was vendored
    or translated; citations live in `wgs.rs` doc comments.
  - **aggregated human-NPC data** for captured humans (villagers, merchants,
    faction thugs, and bounty targets). We derive `app/src/lib/humans.json` from
    that project's `data/json/pals.json` (the `is_pal:false` / `tribe:"Human"`
    rows: stats, work suitabilities, price, boss flags) joined with the English
    localization `data/json/l10n/en/pals.json` (display names). The data is
    re-shaped, not copied verbatim; regenerate it with `bun scripts/gen-humans.mjs`.
  - **human / bounty portrait assets** under `app/public/humans/*.webp`
    (the generic human portrait `t_commonhuman_icon_normal.webp`, the
    `t_boss_npc_*.webp` bounty-target portraits, and merchant/dealer portraits
    such as `salesperson*.webp`), fetched unmodified from that project's
    `ui/src/lib/assets/img/`. These portraits are ultimately Palworld game art ©
    Pocketpair, Inc., included for personal, non-commercial use — the same
    fan-tool practice and provenance as the pal icons above (see the Palworld
    note below). `scripts/gen-humans.mjs` downloads only the icons actually
    referenced by `humans.json`.

## 5. Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor — MIT (format-documentation reference only)

- Upstream: https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor
- License: MIT (Copyright (c) 2021 Mark Mäkinen)
- What we use: **nothing is vendored or ported.** Cross-reference for the
  generic Xbox WGS container format (`containers.index`, blob GUID naming)
  implemented in `crates/pal-save/src/wgs.rs`.

## French game terminology — Pocketpair / Palpedia reference

The display dictionaries in `app/src/i18n/game-fr.json` and
`game-ids-fr.json` use Palworld game names and localized descriptions referenced
from Palpedia.com on 2026-09-30 (game data v1.0.4):

- https://palpedia.com/fr/pals
- https://palpedia.com/fr/passive-skills
- https://palpedia.com/fr/skills
- https://palpedia.com/fr/partner-skills
- https://palpedia.com/fr/items

Entries are matched by stable internal IDs, catalogue IDs or identical species
slugs. The current pack's English names are retained in all save and solver
contracts. Ambiguous partner rank templates have manual French translations
with unchanged numeric slots. Palpedia's editorial guides, site code, images
and design are not incorporated. Game strings belong to Pocketpair, Inc.
