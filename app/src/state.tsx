//   - `saveSummary`  the parsed roster + players + warnings, cached
//   - `roster`       per-species owned tally, DERIVED from `saveSummary`
//   - `view`         the active nav view (so the dex can jump to the Solver)
//   - `solveTarget`  a pending species *name* the Solver pre-fills once
//   - `dexTarget`    a pending species *id* the Pal-dex opens once
//   - `dexInstance`  the owned-instance hex guid to enrich that dex page with
// The last-used folder is persisted to localStorage and used to prefill the
// startup modal, but the app never auto-loads a save on boot.
